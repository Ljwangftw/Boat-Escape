## Download Options

### Browse Only
- Use the GitHub web UI to view the README, code, and commit history.

### Clone with Git LFS (recommended)
1. Install Git and Git LFS (one-time):
   - Windows: `winget install Git.Git`
   - macOS: `brew install git-lfs`
   - Linux: use your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install git-lfs`)
2. Enable LFS: `git lfs install`
3. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ljwangftw/Boat-Escape.git`
4. If you already have a clone, run `git lfs pull` to download the full `.glb` models.
5. Open the project and follow *How to Run the Game*.

### Pre-packaged ZIP
- Download `Boat-Escape-full.zip` from the repository [Releases](https://github.com/Ljwangftw/Boat-Escape/releases/latest) page. This archive is generated from the LFS-enabled working tree so it already contains the full-size `.glb` models.
- Extract the archive and run the project as described above.

---

## Recruiter Notes
- The repo uses Git LFS for large `.glb` models; GitHub''s default "Download ZIP" only contains 1 KB pointer files.
- The *Pre-packaged ZIP* release asset or a full Git clone are the two ways to get the ready-to-run project with assets.

## Need Help?

If the game doesn''t work:
